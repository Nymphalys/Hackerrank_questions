/*We define the distance between two array values as the number of indices between the two values. Given , find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, print .
For example, if , there are two matching pairs of values: . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is .
