/*John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers. One rotation operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all remaining elements right one. To test Sherlockâ€™s abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the rotation operation a number of times then determine the value of the element at a given position.

For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the values of the elements at the given indices.

Example

a = [3,4,5]

k = 2

queries = [1,2]

Here k is the number of rotations on a, and queries holds the list of indices to report. First we perform the two rotations: [3,4,5] -> [5,3,4] -> [4,5,3] 

Now return the values from the zero-based indices 1 and 2 as indicated in the queries array.

a[1] = 5

a[5] = 3

Function Description

Complete the circularArrayRotation function in the editor below.

circularArrayRotation has the following parameter(s):

int a[n]: the array to rotate
int k: the rotation count
int queries[1]: the indices to report
Returns

int[q]: the values in the rotated  as requested in 
Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, n, k, and q, the number of elements in the integer array, the rotation count and the number of queries.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes array element  a[i] (where 0<=i<n ).
Each of the q subsequent lines contains a single integer,queries[i] , an index of an element in a to return.
